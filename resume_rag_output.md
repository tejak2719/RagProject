**Question:** List all the projects mentioned in this resume.

**Answer:** <think>
Okay, I need to list all the projects mentioned in this resume. Let me start by reading through the document carefully. The user has provided a detailed resume with various sections, including "Projects" and "Freelance Side Projects." 

First, I'll look for the "Projects" section. There's a section titled "Projects" under the Freelance Side Projects, but wait, no, the main Projects section is actually under the main content. Let me check again.

Looking at the structure, after the "Technical Skills" section, there's a "Projects" section. Let me go through that. The first project listed is "Recreating Google Lens for LRA." Then there's "Land Record Automation," followed by "PMFBY & Village Master Dashboard Data Mapping," and "Deepfake Model Integration." Then there's another "Projects" section under the Freelance Side Projects, which includes similar entries. Wait, but the user might have duplicated the Projects section. Let me check again.

Wait, the user's resume has two "Projects" sections. The first one is under the main content, and the second is under the Freelance Side Projects. But when I look at the text, the Projects section under the main content includes four projects: Recreating Google Lens for LRA, Land Record Automation, PMFBY & Village Master Dashboard Data Mapping, and Deepfake Model Integration. Then, under Freelance Side Projects, there's another Projects section that lists the same projects again? Wait, no, looking at the text again, the Freelance Side Projects section includes the same projects but perhaps with more details. Wait, no, the user might have duplicated the Projects section. Let me re-examine the text.

The resume starts with the main content, then under the Freelance Side Projects, there's another Projects section. Wait, no. Let me parse the structure again.

Looking at the user's input, after the "Technical Skills" section, there's a "Projects" section. Then, after the "Freelance Side Projects" section, there's another "Projects" section. Wait, that can't be right. Let me check the exact text.

The user's text has:

- After the Technical Skills section, there's a "Projects" section with entries: Recreating Google Lens for LRA, Land Record Automation, PMFBY & Village Master Dashboard Data Mapping, Deepfake Model Integration, FUTURE Group & PA India - FM CG (Products Marketability Analysis).

Wait, no, looking again, the Projects section under the main content includes four projects. Then, under the Freelance Side Projects, there's another "Projects" section with the same four projects? Or is there a different one? Wait, the user's input is a bit confusing. Let me re-express the structure.

The main content includes:

- Technical Skills

Then, under the main content, after Technical Skills, there's a "Projects" section with:

1. Recreating Google Lens for LRA
2. Land Record Automation
3. PMFBY & Village Master Dashboard Data Mapping
4. Deepfake Model Integration
5. FUTURE Group & PA India - FM CG (Products Marketability Analysis)

Wait, no. Wait, the user's input has the Projects section under the main content, which includes:

Recreating Google Lens for LRA
Land Record Automation
PMFBY & Village Master Dashboard Data Mapping
Deepfake Model Integration
FUTURE Group & PA India - FM CG (Products Marketability Analysis)

Wait, but the user's text has the Projects section under the main content. Then, after that, there's the Freelance Side Projects section, which also includes a Projects section? Or is that part of the Freelance Side Projects?

Wait, the user's input is a bit messy. Let me try to parse it again.

The original text starts with the main content, including the "Projects" section. Then, after that, there's a section titled "Freelance Side Projects June 2023 – Ongoing" which includes the same projects again? Or is that part of the Freelance Side Projects?

Wait, no. The Freelance Side Projects section includes the same projects but perhaps with more details? Or maybe the Projects section under Freelance Side Projects is a duplicate. Alternatively, the user may have made a mistake in formatting, leading to duplicated sections.

Alternatively, perhaps the main Projects section includes the first four projects, and the Freelance Side Projects section includes the same projects again. But that seems redundant. Alternatively, the Freelance Side Projects section includes the same projects but with more details. However, the user's question is to list all projects mentioned in the resume, regardless of duplication.

Therefore, I need to list all unique projects mentioned. Let me go through the entire text again.

Looking at the entire text:

Under the main content, after Technical Skills, there's a "Projects" section:

Recreating Google Lens for LRA
Land Record Automation
PMFBY & Village Master Dashboard Data Mapping
Deepfake Model Integration
FUTURE Group & PA India - FM CG (Products Marketability Analysis)

Then, under the Freelance Side Projects section, there's another Projects section, which includes:

Recreating Google Lens for LRA
Land Record Automation
PMFBY & Village Master Dashboard Data Mapping
Deepfake Model Integration
FUTURE Group & PA India - FM CG (Products Marketability Analysis)

Wait, but the user's input has the same projects listed in both sections. That would mean the projects are listed twice. However, the user might have made a formatting error. Alternatively, the Projects section under Freelance Side Projects is part of the Freelance Side Projects, and the main Projects section is separate. But the user might have duplicated the projects. To be safe, I should list all projects mentioned, even if they are duplicated.

Alternatively, the FUTURE Group & PA India project is under the main content's Projects section, and the Freelance Side Projects section includes the same projects. Therefore, the projects are listed twice. However, the user's question is to list all projects mentioned, so I need to include each project once, even if they are duplicated. Alternatively, the user may have intended the main Projects section to include all projects, and the Freelance Side Projects section is separate. But the way it's written is confusing.

Alternatively, the main Projects section includes the first four projects, and the Freelance Side Projects section includes the same projects again. So, the projects are listed in two different sections, but they are the same. Therefore, the answer should list each project once, even if they are mentioned in multiple sections.

Therefore, the projects are:

1. Recreating Google Lens for LRA
2. Land Record Automation
3. PMFBY & Village Master Dashboard Data Mapping
4. Deepfake Model Integration
5. FUTURE Group & PA India - FM CG (Products Marketability Analysis)

Additionally, under the Freelance Side Projects, there's a mention of "GenAI Proof of Concept" and other projects. Wait, no. Wait, the Freelance Side Projects section includes:
 
- GenAI Proof of Concept
- AI Call Assistant
- Data Cleaning Agent
- Feature Engineering Agent
- Dashboard Intelligence Agent

These are part of the Freelance Side Projects, which are separate from the main Projects section. Therefore, the total projects would be:

From the main Projects section:

1. Recreating Google Lens for LRA
2. Land Record Automation
3. PMFBY & Village Master Dashboard Data Mapping
4. Deepfake Model Integration
5. FUTURE Group & PA India - FM CG (Products Marketability Analysis)

From the Freelance Side Projects:

6. GenAI Proof of Concept
7. AI Call Assistant
8. Data Cleaning Agent
9. Feature Engineering Agent
10. Dashboard Intelligence Agent

So, the total projects are 10. However, in the initial main Projects section, the FUTURE Group project is listed, and then in the Freelance Side Projects, there's another list. Wait, the main Projects section includes the FUTURE Group project, and the Freelance Side Projects section includes the same projects again? Or is the FUTURE Group project part of the main Projects and the Freelance Side Projects have their own projects?

Wait, looking again, the main Projects section includes:

Recreating Google Lens for LRA
Land Record Automation
PMFBY & Village Master Dashboard Data Mapping
Deepfake Model Integration
FUTURE Group & PA India - FM CG (Products Marketability Analysis)

Then, under Freelance Side Projects, the projects are:

GenAI Proof of Concept
AI Call Assistant
Data Cleaning Agent
Feature Engineering Agent
Dashboard Intelligence Agent

Therefore, the total projects are 5 (main) + 5 (Freelance) = 10 projects. However, the user's original question might have a different structure. Let me verify once more.

In the original text, the main Projects section includes the first four projects and the FUTURE Group project. Then, under Freelance Side Projects, there's another list of projects. Therefore, the answer should list all 10 projects.
